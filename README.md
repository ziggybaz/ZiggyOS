#### There's nothing I could say, write or implement that you wouldn't get from the source material so here's a link to *probably the best introductory book on OS' on the market and a fine blog to match:

[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

[Writing an OS in Rust ](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
